    "kNN is an example of instance-based learning, where we need to have instances of data close at hand to perform the machine learning algorithm. The algorithm has to carry around the full dataset; for large datasets, this implies a large amount of storage. In addition, we need to calculate the distance measurement for every piece of data in the database, and this can be cumbersome. \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional drawback is that kNN doesn’t give us any idea of the underlying structure of the data; we have no idea what an *average* or *exemplar* instance from each class looks like. \n",
